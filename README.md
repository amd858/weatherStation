"# weatherStation" 
The provided code is an Arduino sketch that control a heating, cooling, and humidity control system based on various sensors and user input. Here is a brief summary of the key functionalities:

### Hardware Components:
- DHTesp library for temperature and humidity sensing.
- DFRobot_SHT20 library for additional temperature and humidity sensing.
- LiquidCrystal_I2C library for controlling a 16x4 LCD display.
- Infrared (IR) remote control using an IR receiver (connected to pin 4).
- Various buttons and switches connected to different pins.

### Constants and Pin Definitions:
- Constants and pin definitions for buttons, IR pin, dip switches, and other peripherals.

### Initialization:
- Initialization of sensors, pins, and the LCD display in the `setup()` function.

### Functions:
1. **`press_rc_button` Function:**
   - Simulates pressing an IR remote control button.

2. **`ac_on_sensor_fault` and `heater_on_sensor_fault` Functions:**
   - Simulate button presses when a sensor fault is detected for the AC or heater.

3. **`heating_enable` and `heating_disable` Functions:**
   - Simulate button presses to enable or disable heating.

4. **`ac_cooling_enable` and `ac_cooling_disable` Functions:**
   - Simulate button presses to enable or disable AC cooling.

5. **`ac_power_toggle` Function:**
   - Simulates toggling the power state of the AC.

6. **`humidifier_on` and `humidifier_off` Functions:**
   - Control the indication of the humidifier by setting a pin HIGH or LOW.

7. **`repeat_action_remaining_time_string_get` Function:**
   - Calculate and return the remaining time in the repeat action interval.

8. **`heater_processing` and `ac_processing` Functions:**
   - Implement the logic for controlling the heating and cooling based on temperature and humidity.

9. **`loop` Function:**
   - Continuously reads temperature, humidity, and heat index.
   - Calls the appropriate processing function based on the selected mode (heater or cooler).
   - Updates the LCD display with relevant information.

### Notes:
- The code uses state machines (`heater_state` and `ac_state`) to handle different states of the heating and cooling systems.
- The program simulates button presses in response to specific conditions, such as temperature thresholds or sensor faults.
- The LCD display provides information about the system's current state, temperature, humidity, and desired conditions.

Remember to check your hardware connections and ensure that the required libraries are installed in your Arduino IDE for successful compilation and execution.
